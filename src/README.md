I wrote this mostly because I wanted to learn D, but also
as a general library for me to use for my experiments.

I myopically called it optimization because that was the first
thing that I wanted to do with it; however I got carried away
and started implementing things like Probability (the coolest class ever)
and LDA.

Enjoy
